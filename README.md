# Class Project

Authors: Akash Shukla, Bishoy Kousa, Carson McVay, Leslie Zhang

This is a repo for the PHY 381c final project. The project focuses on applying NetKet to minimize Hamiltonians and compute the ground states. Netket is a jax-powered machine learning toolbox specifically designed for quantum systems.

Package Requirements:
platform, netket, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, time, jax, jax.np
